//In this we will see comparison operators like >,<,>=,<=,==,!=,===,!==

console.log(2>1);
console.log(3<7);
console.log(2>=6);
console.log(2<=5);

console.log("2" == 2);// It gives true as there is data type conversion happens it is converted to 2 and 2 ==2 so true
console.log("2" === 2);// It give false as this is === strict data type check is checked as string is compared with number its false

console.log(null>0);
console.log(null<0);
console.log(null>=0);//True as null is converted to 0 in Boolean data type conversion as true


console.log(undefined>0);
console.log(undefined<0);
console.log(undefined<=0);
